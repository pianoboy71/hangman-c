# Hangman
This is a twist on the classic game of Hangman, where you can play it in your terminal, and it is written entirely in C!

## Setup
If you have `gcc` installed, open the repo in your terminal and run the following: `gcc main.c hangman.c -o hangman`.
The you will have an executable file (`hangman` on Unix-type systems, or `hangman.exe` on Windows) for you to run and play Hangman!
The executable file doesn't come pre-packaged with the repo, you have to make it or

## What if that's too annoying and I don't want to do that?
If you are on Windows, you can look in the "Releases" section of the repo and download the exe file straight from there!
If you are on a Unix system, you will very likely want to do it yourself, but there is a program compiled from Mac in the "Releases" section as well if not.

## Improvements
If you have any improvements you think should be made, you can create an issue within the repo, or fork it and create it yourself, when I will then look it over and merge it if it works with the game.

Enjoy!
